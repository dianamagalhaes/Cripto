This work is dedicated to a class in university
This Repo is a work made to university.


About TP1: We had 3 cryptograms that were encrypted with substituion cypher, vigenere cipher and affine cipher and we had to crack them. For that we used the code at the folder.

About TP2: This paper is about 20 cryptograms that were generated using the OneTime Pad in an incorrect way.
The cryptograms are known to correspond to two clear text messages, ciphered with different keys-except in the case of two cryptograms, which were ciphered using the same key.

About TP4: This exercise was used to implement primitives that provide confidentiality, the first will be the HMAC, and the second will be the ChaCha20 figure.
Three modes of the encrypt-then-mac, encrypt-and-mac and mac-then-encrypt scheme were implemented.
