This work is dedicated to a class in university
This Repo is a work made to university.
About TP1: We had 3 cryptograms that were encrypted with substituion cypher, vigenere cipher and affine cipher and we had to crack them. For that we used the code at the folder.

About TP2: This paper is about 20 cryptograms that were generated using the OneTime Pad in an incorrect way.
The cryptograms are known to correspond to two clear text messages, ciphered with different keys-except in the case of two cryptograms, which were ciphered using the same key.
